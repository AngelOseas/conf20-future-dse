### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r pressure_table}
DT::datatable(pressure, options = list(pageLength = 10, 
                                       rownames = FALSE))
```

### Including a ggplot

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure_graph}
theme_set(theme_minimal())
g <- ggplot(pressure, aes(x=temperature, y=pressure)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
ggplotly(g, height=400)
```
